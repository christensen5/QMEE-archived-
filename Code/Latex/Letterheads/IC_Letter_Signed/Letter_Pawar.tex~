I am writing this letter in support of Adam Sharp's application to the
Postgraduate program in the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College,
London.

I have known Adam since October 2013, when he entered the MRes Biodiversity
Informatics and Genomics program at Silwood Park. I have been impressed by
Adam's work ethic and his ability to efficiently and effectively learn new and
difficult techniques, both at the computational and mathematical end of things.
He is also a strongly-motivated and inquisitive biologist. 

Based upon my interactions with previous years' graduate student cohorts, I
would easily place Matt among the top 10\% of the Department's MS students.
Clearly, my assessment is well backed by Adam's excellent academic and
extracurricular record in his High School and BSc years. In the current MRes as
well, Adam is well-placed to obtain at least a 2:1 degree. 

I am confident that Adam will make an exceptional PhD student, and I
wholeheartedly support his application.
