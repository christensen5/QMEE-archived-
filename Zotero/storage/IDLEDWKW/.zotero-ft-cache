Abstract
Vertical mixing can transport nutrients from deep layer to euphotic zone. Therefore, it plays a very important role for biological productivity. Also, it can transport phytoplankton vertically and varies light exposure history of individual phytoplankton. When phytoplankton_fs response to the ambient light intensity is slow compare to the time scale of vertical mixing, production averaged in space can be varied caused by vertical mixing. In the past, such effects of vertical mixing on the photoresponse of phytoplankton have been considered with constant eddy diffusivity. However, vertical mixing is not independent of time, and variable vertical mixing in time should be examined for the Lagrangian photoresponse. In present study, a 2nd-order turbulence closure approach was coupled with a Lagrangian phytoplankton model, in order to examine the effect of time-dependent vertical eddy diffusion on the photoresponse of phytoplankton in a wind-driven upper mixing layer. In general, stronger wind mixing in a lower-transparency water column contributes to greater phytoplankton production. According to our study, vertical mixing is insignificant for photoinhibition in relatively clear open ocean water, while it can be more important in relatively turbid coastal water. A simple Ekman layer model provided surprisingly similar production to that observed with the 2nd-order closure scheme when the starting distribution of the phytoplankton cells was normalized. Two factors involved in the process are the change in the background stratification and the time dependence of the diffusivity coefficient. The influences of these 2 factors cancel each other to reduce the apparent difference between the total production estimated by the Ekman model compared to that estimated by the 2nd-order closure scheme.

INTRODUCTION
Although photosynthesis is a function of irradiance,
photosynthetic production varies with time even
though phytoplankton are gr own under constant light
intensity (Prezelin & Ley 1980). Thus, a simple and sta-
tionary pr oduction, P , against irradiance, I , appr oxima-
tion is not realistic. Mar ra (1978a) observed even mor e
complex patterns in the time dependence of the photo-
synthetic capacity of Lauderia borealis gr own under
varying light conditions. Based on these experimental
r esults, Denman & Mar ra (1986) developed a photore-
sponse model (DM model) that repr oduces the essen-
tial features in Mar ra’ s (1978a) data. V ertical mixing in
the upper ocean layer transports phytoplankton caus-
ing a variety of light intensity conditions for each cell.
Mixing in the upper ocean plays an important r ole
for the phytoplankton production (Lewis et al. 1984). In
general, when vertical mixing is weak, so that the
timescale of the vertical transpor t is much longer than
the photoresponse timescale, phytoplankton have time
to respond to the sur rounding light intensity and each
depth attains a locally derived P – I relationship com-
pared to other depths. On the other hand, when ver ti-
cal mixing is stronger, a phytoplankton cell does not
have sufficient time to adjust to the ambient light con-
dition. In the latter case, a variety of photoacclimation
characteristics may simultaneously exist at a given
depth depending on the light exposure histor y and
r esponse times of the individual cells at that depth at a
given time (Dusenberr y et al. 2000). Also, the total pro-
duction rate in the upper ocean can be differ ent from
that without mixing (Dusenberr y 2000). In fact, Marra
(1978b) found that averaged production of Lauderia
borealis increased due to ver tical mixing. Another
important physiological aspect is that a cer tain period
of time under the light is requir ed to realize the full
photosynthetic potential in turbid water columns (Gei-

ABSTRACT : A 2nd-or der turbulence closure appr oach was coupled with a Lagrangian phytoplank-
ton model, in order to examine the ef fect of time-dependent vertical eddy dif fusion on the photo-
r esponse of phytoplankton in a wind-driven upper mixing layer. In general, stronger wind mixing in
a lower-transparency water column contributes to greater phytoplankton pr oduction. According to
our study , ver tical mixing is insignificant for photoinhibition in relatively clear open ocean water,
while it can be more impor tant in relatively turbid coastal water. A simple Ekman layer model pro-
vided surprisingly similar production to that obser ved with the 2nd-order closur e scheme when the
starting distribution of the phytoplankton cells was nor malized. T wo factors involved in the pr ocess
are the change in the backgr ound stratification and the time dependence of the diffusivity coef ficient.
The influences of these 2 factors cancel each other to reduce the appar ent differ ence between the
total production estimated by the Ekman model compar ed to that estimated by the 2nd-order closur e
scheme.

der et al. 1996). These time responses to ir radiance are
major topics in Lagrangian phytoplankton studies.
To faithfully mimic how phytoplankton cells are
transported and ar e experiencing varying light condi-
tions, random walk models, i.e. Lagrangian models,
have been developed (Falkowski & Wirick 1981,
W oods & Onken 1982, Lande & Lewis 1989, Y amazaki
& Kamykowski 1991, Franks & Marra 1994, Kamy-
kowski et al. 1994). Alternate Lagrangian appr oaches
were pr ovided by Barkmann & Woods (1997) and
Broekhuizen (1999). Pr evious Lagrangian studies have
focused on the biological aspect of irradiance ef fects,
while less emphasis has been placed on the physical
structur e and dynamics. In contrast, Chen & Annan
(2000) demonstrated that the timing of the spring
bloom, the maintenance of the midwater chlorophyll a
(chl a ) maximum and the gross primar y production
vary when dif ferent turbulence closur e schemes are
applied. Similar physical comparisons are needed at
shorter timescales r elated to phytoplankton photore-
sponse rates.
Solar radiation provides heat and causes changes in
water column buoyancy . During nighttime, the sur face
cooling causes convective mixing; during the day , solar
radiation attenuates the intensity of the convection and
induces a restratified water column (Brainer d & Gregg
1993). When vertical mixing destr oys a stable stratifi-
cation, vertical over turn does not r equire much kinetic
energy. A typical diurnal cycle of the upper layer
shows an alternating patter n of destratification and
r estratification. Never theless, the diurnal changes of
stratification and mixing were not r outinely incorpo-
rated into Lagrangian simulations (Y amazaki & Kamy-
kowski 1991, Franks & Marra 1994). Far mer & McNeil
(1999) conducted a Lagrangian phytoplankton simula-
tion using the DM model. They used neutrally buoyant
float data obtained from a field experiment in which
floats circulated thr ough the full extent of the diurnally
varying upper mixed layer, in order to r eproduce the
vertical excursion of a phytoplankton cell. Although
the photoresponse in their r esult was noticeable, the
production was not compar ed quantitatively to a non-
mixing case.
Janowitz & Kamykowski (1991) considered the diur-
nal convective aspect using an Eulerian approach.
They repor ted an excellent agreement between field
data repr esenting the thermal stratification cycle, pho-
toinhibition and primary pr oductivity in Lake Titicaca
and their predicted tr ends for these factors in a simu-
lated water column over a diel cycle. A similar attempt
should be made for Lagrangian studies to investigate
the effects of diur nal mixing on the production.
In the present study, we coupled the Lagrangian
photoresponse model of Kamykowski et al. (1994) with
a 2nd-order turbulence closur e model (Mellor &
Y amada 1982), in or der to take the diurnal variation of
mixing into consideration in a Lagrangian context. We
also compared the pr evious model results based on the
Ekman layer model (YK scheme; Y amazaki & Kamy-
kowski 1991) with the new simulation results. The
objectives of our studies are to clarify the ef fects of
wind mixing and diel photoresponse on the daily pr o-
duction in a realistic wind-mixed water column and to
r eveal the dif ference between the pr evious YK results
and the new simulations based on a closure scheme.
MA TERIALS AND METHODS
T wo dif ferent formulations for estimating the eddy
diffusivity due to turbulence ar e used in this study . We
employed a Mellor – Y amada level 2.5 quasi-equilib-
rium 2nd-order turbulence closur e model (Mellor &
Y amada 1984) that is applied to linearized shallow
water equations. The stratification is expressed in
terms of temperatur e. This new Mellor – Y amada model
(MY scheme) is compared with the pr evious Ekman
layer model of Y amazaki & Kamykowski (1991). The
latter model does not consider the buoyancy change
due to mixing and, for a given wind condition, the eddy
diffusivity does not change with time.
MY scheme. The governing equations ar e linearized
shallow-water equations and the thermal dif fusivity
equation:

where U is east – west horizontal velocity component
(positive eastward), V is north – south horizontal
velocity component (positive northwar d), T is temper-
ature and ƒ is the Coriolis parameter. W e assume hor-
izontal homogeneity for all variables. The tempera-
ture pr ofile changes due to vertical turbulent
diffusion. Solar radiation pr ovides heat into the water
column, and constant nighttime cooling is assumed in
this model. The density change δρ is a function of
temperature only:

where δ T is the temperature dif ference fr om a refer-
ence point and α is the coefficient of ther mal expan-
sion. V er tical turbulent diffusion of momentum and
heat are parameterized in ter ms of eddy diffusivity

for heat. The eddy dif-
fusivity of momentum and heat are pr ovided by the
Mellor-Y amada level 2.5 quasi-equilibrium turbulence
closure scheme (Galperin et al. 1988, Deleersnijder &
Luyten 1994). Details of closures wer e discussed in
Mellor & Y amada (1984).
Momentum flux at the surface of the model domain
is described as:
(5)
where ρ
w
is the density of water and τ
w
is wind stress at
the surface. The velocity vector, V
→
, has U and V com-
ponents. We used a bulk formulation for τ
w
estimated
from the 10 m height wind speed, U
10
:
(6)
where ρ
a
is the density of air and C
f
is a frictional coef-
ficient.
Solar radiation, I ( z ), is formulated fr om Kraus (1972)
using 2 exponential functions to treat an infrar ed ray
(long wavelength light: > 780 nm), which rapidly
decays in the upper few meters, and a visible ray (short
wavelength light: 400 nm < wavelength < 700 nm),
which penetrates deeper into the water column
(7)
where I
max
sin( t π  12) is solar radiation at the surface, λ
1
and λ
2
are e-folding distances for infrar ed ray and visi-
ble ray , r espectively . When I ( z ) is negative, the value is
set to 0. The visible ray band is also refer red to as
photosynthetically active radiation (P AR) used in sup-
port of phytoplankton primar y productivity. The day
length is 12 h in this model as in Eq. (7). We neglect all
boundary fluxes except at the sur face.
YK scheme. The law of the wall is used to express the
diffusivity coef ficient (Y amazaki & Kamykowski 1991).
In this model, Lagrangian dispersion is expressed in
terms of the following dif fusion coefficient K

where ε is the dissipation rate from the law of the wall,
ν is the kinematic viscosity and N is the buoyancy fre-
quency . The dissipation rate decr eases with depth up
to the Ekman layer depth ( h
E
):
(9)
where κ is the von Karman constant, and u
*
is the
shear velocity . T urbulence mixes par ticles between the
surface and the bottom of the Ekman layer. No turbu-
lent mixing is considered below the Ekman layer. In
the YK scheme, the background stratification is set to a
constant: 0.001.
Random walk model. An individual particle is
advanced from position Z
n
at time step n by δ Z for each
step:
Z
n +1
= Z
n
+ δ Z (10)
The random walk step size δ Z is a function of the ver-
tical diffusivity. When the diffusivity does not change
in space, the probability density function for the step
size also does not have to change in space. However,
when the diffusivity changes in space, it is necessar y to
add a corr ection term, in or der to avoid unrealistic
advective phenomena (Hunter et al. 1993, Visser
1997). We used the correction scheme pr oposed by
V isser (1997) because this scheme avoids an unrealis-
tic accumulation of particles even when the dif fusivity
changes abruptly (Appendix 1).
(11)
where N is a standar d Gaussian probability density
function and K ’
z
is the first derivative of the diffusivity.
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (11) is a tur-
bulent advection term, which transpor ts particles fr om
a low to a high-diffusivity r egion, in order to avoid
unphysical aggregation of par ticles.
The MY scheme generates discrete K
z
values at
simulated grid points; hence, a cubic spline interpola-
tion is used to estimate the K
z
value and the derivative
at a non-grid point. When the diffusivity is close to 0,
the corr ection scheme does not work properly and
creates unphysical aggr egation. T o avoid this pr ob-
lem, we applied a background dif fusivity of 10

Photoresponse model. The DM model is used in this
study where only exter nal light exposure contr ols cel-
lular light response. The photosynthesis versus ir radi-
ance curve is expr essed as a simple function of light
intensity:

Simulations. A computing domain for the MY
scheme is between the surface and 500 m depth, but
we use only the upper 100 m data to avoid the bot-
tom boundary ef fects. Since the deepest Ekman layer
is 54 m for the 10 m s
–1
wind case, the YK scheme
considers the upper 100 m. The bottom of the Ekman
layer is treated as a r eflective boundary condition as
in Franks & Marra (1994). For both schemes, the ini-
tial condition of stratification is set to N = 0.001 s

,
as in Y amazaki & Kamykowski (1991). To faithfully
compare the MY scheme with the YK scheme, we
take initial conditions of both q

surface at sunset. This condition is the same as in
Y amazaki & Kamykowski (1991). We refer to this con-
dition as the point source (PS).
RESUL TS
We focus our attention on the US condition except for
a few PS cases run, in or der to compare the cur rent
simulation with our previous work (Yamazaki &
Kamykowski 1991, Kamykowski et al. 1994, Kamy-
kowski & Y amazaki 1997). The PS r esults are intr o-
duced in the ‘Discussion’.
Eddy diffusivity
The time variation of eddy diffusivity obtained fr om
the MY scheme is shown in Fig. 1. All cases show a
similar pattern in which the eddy dif fusivity is reduced
during daytime due to increased buoyancy. As the
solar radiation decreases in the after noon, the eddy
diffusivity incr eases with time due to convection asso-
ciated with cooling until sunrise in the next morning.
The transparency of water, λ , affects the stability of the
water column. With low transparency (Table 1),
weaker mixing intensity is expected, and the mixing
layer depth cannot grow due to elevated buoyancy
(Fig. 1). This tendency is obvious in Fig. 1 as the high
eddy diffusivity r egion is reduced when λ
2
is low . The
contours for K
z
deepen from Types 9 to I water and are
deeper under higher wind speeds (Fig. 1).
The important point is that ther e are 2 major aspects
due to buoyancy , contr olling the eddy diffusivity calcu-
lated by the MY scheme. One is the strengthening of
the stratification by solar heating that can reduce the
eddy diffusivity. The other is weakening of the strati-
fication due to cooling during nighttime that can
enhance diffusivity. These 2 processes have opposite
effects on mixing intensity.
A comparison of the eddy diffusivity based on the
MY and YK schemes is shown in Fig. 2. Since YK eddy
diffusivity is constant with time, we computed an aver-

age MY eddy diffusivity pr ofile to compare with YK
values. MY eddy diffusivity is averaged between 09:00
and 15:00 h because photosynthesis is most active
between these times. At the surface, MY eddy dif fusiv-
ity is 0 by definition and is always smaller than the YK
scheme values (Fig. 2). A comparison of depth aver-
aged eddy diffusivities (see the bars in Fig. 2 and
T able 3) over the region where PAR > 200.0 µE m

s
–1
(which is shallower than the broken line in Fig. 1) indi-
cates that MY eddy diffusivity for the 10 m s
–1
wind
case is 5.7, 2.6 and 1.2 times larger than that for the YK
scheme for T ypes I, III and 9 water, respectively . When
the wind speed is 5.0 m s
–1
, the differ ence in the depth
averaged eddy diffusivity between the 2 schemes is
insignificant.
The YK scheme is based on ε from the law of the
wall. T o check whether the MY ε follows the law of the
wall, ε profiles fr om the MY run ar e averaged from the

Photoresponse

ment takes place only when the penetrating PAR ex-
ceeds threshold ir radiance, i.e. 200 µE m

(bro-
ken line in Fig. 1). Increased ver tical excursion of
phytoplankton in the mixing layer reduces photoin-
hibition. T o establish a r eference point for the effects
of mixing, we first examined how the inhibition
arises without turbulent mixing (Fig. 4). This pro-
vides a possible minimum production or maximum
inhibition without any recover y of production asso-
ciated with turbulent vertical mixing. Hence, we ran
the refer ence simulations with background diffusion
that is at a molecular diffusivity of 10

For the cases without turbulent mixing,
the inhibition parameter, Y , was averaged
over 100 s, and a 0.05 (depth λ
2
–1
) optical
depth bin is used to show the values in
Fig. 4. At an arbitrary depth, Y incr eases
to a maximum value 1 h after noon due to
the delay in response time (Fig. 4a,b,c).
The amount of PAR absorbed in the water
column increases with λ
2
; also R in Eq. (7)
decreases with λ
2
(Table 1), so that
stronger inhibition is expected in mor e
transparent water. The instantaneous pro-
duction is maximal at a subsurface that
deepens during the morning and
becomes shallow in the afternoon (Fig.
4d,e,f).
The effect of mixing can be investigated
by the calculation of a production anomaly
from the non-mixing case. A positive
anomaly value repr esents an increased
production due to mixing. As a general
trend, a positive anomaly appears in upper r egions
of the mixed layer, while a negative anomaly occurs
in the lower portion of the mixed layer (Figs. 5 & 6).
Negative anomalies were also obser ved by
Janowitz & Kamykowski (1991) toward sunset in
their Eulerian mixed-layer model. The negative
anomaly occurs just below the positive one, since
vertical mixing conveys uninhibited cells upwar ds
and inhibited cells downwards. When Type I water
is examined, the MY anomaly is considerably differ-
ent from the YK anomaly (Figs. 5 & 6). The positive
anomaly for MY that appeared in the mor ning is
much larger than the YK values. The subsur face
negative values for MY are also lar ger than the YK
values. The negative anomaly for YK that appeared
at a constant depth corr esponds to the base of the
Ekman layer . The reflective boundar y condition im-
posed on this model causes this rather artificial
anomaly peak.
Note that a nearly 0 anomaly appears in the
upper layer around noon in both schemes, despite
the fact that mixing is continuously stirring individ-
ual cells (Figs. 5 & 6). Fully inhibited value profiles
are plotted with optical depth (depth λ
2
–1
) for each
water type every 2 h (Fig. 7). Note that with T ype I
water , inhibition is almost constant with depth in
the upper layer especially at 12:00 h (Fig. 7a).
Therefor e, Y is not changing as a result of ver tical
displacement in this region. In other wor ds, the
mixing through a layer in which X is constant does
not eliminate inhibition. This X pr ofile’ s shape is
very critical for the variance, the anomaly and also

Fig. 6. Anomaly of instantaneous production based on the MY
scheme. Refer to Fig. 5. for details
Nagai et al.: A Lagrangian model for the photoresponse of phytoplankton
production. Since MY pr ovides a time-
dependent diffusivity, whereas YK uses
a constant diffusivity, a different pat-
tern in the anomalies is expected. In
fact, the anomaly features obtained
from a Type I water case, show a signif-
icant discrepancy between the 2
schemes. For the MY scheme, rela-
tively high positive and negative
anomalies appear in the morning,
while the anomaly is much reduced in
the afternoon (Fig. 6). Thus, the anom-
aly is an asymmetric pattern. On the
other hand, the YK scheme shows
almost symmetric anomaly patterns for
5 and 10 m s
–1
(Fig. 5a,b). For the other
levels of transparency, the anomaly
features obtained fr om MY and YK are
similar . Since the euphotic zone is
rather shallow , the eddy dif fusivity for
MY stays within a limited range and
does not vary significantly fr om the
morning to the after noon (Fig. 1). As a
r esult, the anomaly appears nearly
symmetric, and resembles the YK
anomaly (Figs. 5 & 6).
Daily total production
The total production pr ovided by 1000 cells, P , is
accumulated during the entire simulation for each sim-
ulation case. The accumulated total production, ∑ P , is
normalized by the accumulated total pr oduction for
non-mixing case, ∑ P
Non-mixing
. We examine the ratio of
∑ P and ∑ P
Non-mixing
:
P
R
= ∑ P / ∑ P
Non-mixing
(19)
P
R
increases with wind speed for both the MY and
YK schemes. In total, 30 realizations wer e made to
compile statistics for each case. The values of P
R
are
shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4. The increase in P
R
is a
function of λ
2
. The lower values of λ
2
corr espond to the
higher P
R
values. The result is similar to Lewis et al.
(1984) and Franks & Marra (1994). The P
R
ratio for T ype
I case does not exceed 1.03 even when the wind speed
is 10 m s
–1
. With T ype 9 coastal water, P
R
r eaches mor e
than 1.05. These tendencies obtained from MY and YK
are surprisingly close, despite the fact that MY is time-
dependent and YK is stationary. The standard devia-
tion of P
R
, σ, decreases with λ
2
(bar plots in Fig. 8),
because only a small part of the pseudo-cells can con-
tribute to the elimination of inhibition by vertical mix-
ing when λ
2
is small. A t -test is perfor med to examine a
null hypothesis that the 2 schemes provide identical
r esults. At a 5 % significance level, all cases, except
T ypes III and 9 for 10 m s
–1
wind speed, are statistically
identical. The MY production anomaly for Type I water
and 5 m s
–1
wind speed is differ ent from the YK r esult
(Figs. 5 & 6), but the total production is identical. The 3
other identical cases show a similar anomaly pattern
(Figs. 5 & 6), and the actual production is also close
(Fig. 8).

DISCUSSION
We employed 2 differ ent schemes to compute the
eddy diffusivity in the mixing layer. One is the simplest
stationary scheme (YK) and the other is a computation-
ally elaborated time-dependent scheme (MY). An
unexpected result is that the 2 schemes pr ovide rea-
sonably similar estimates of accumulated total photo-
synthetic production over 24 h. We investigate the rea-
sons and consider the implications.
Dependence on the initial conditions
The initial condition, US, used in this study is identi-
cal to that in Franks & Marra (1994), and dif fers from
the PS of Y amazaki & Kamykowski (1991). To investi-
gate the sensitivity of the initial condition, we exam-
ined a few cases for which the largest change fr om the
r efer ence state (non-mixing case) is expected, namely
the T ype 9 coastal water case. T wo differ ent scenarios
are tested: (1) star ting from sunset with a unifor m dis-
tribution of cells; and (2) starting fr om sunset with a
point source at the sur face. The eddy diffusivity fr om
the YK scheme is constant with time; therefor e, with
the US initial condition, the starting time does not
affect the r esults. Hence, we do not have to recompute
for cases with differ ent starting times.
W ith the initial condition (1), P
R
ratios from the MY
scheme are 1.04 and 1.15, and P
R
ratios from the YK
scheme are 1.05 and 1.07 for each wind case. When the
wind is 5 m s
–1
, the 2 schemes generate P
R
ratios simi-
lar to the original results. However, when the wind is
10 m s
–1
, the P
R
ratio for the MY scheme shows a larger
value than the original calculation, and the increase in
daily production in the MY simulation (15 %) is a factor
of 2 larger than the YK r esult (7.0 %, Table 4). The
larger P
R
ratio is caused by the morning par t of the sim-
ulation. Nighttime convection ceases after sunrise, but
a residual fr om the previous night still r emains for a
while. This condition is differ ent from the initial condi-
tion starting fr om sunrise. Apparently, the difference is
not so significant when wind speeds are modest. How-
ever, the results indicate that nighttime convective
mixing with strong wind persists until the next mor n-
ing and could change the photosynthesis during the
morning. This significant ef fect of residual convective
mixing for photoresponse is consistent with Far mer &
McNeil (1999).
The results fr om the PS simulation show that the
mixing induces a decrease in the total daily pr oduction
compared with non-mixing condition. The P
R
ratios for
the MY scheme are 0.63 and 0.20, and the P
R
ratios for
YK are 0.50 and 0.35 for each wind condition of 5 and
10 m s
–1
, respectively. The reason for this decrease in
the P
R
ratios is that a large number of cells ar e trans-
ported towar d a deeper region, wher eas all particles
stay at the surface for the non-mixing condition. Since
P AR rapidly decays with depth, the downward vertical
transport induces a decr ease in the total production.
The P
R
ratio for YK is slightly smaller than that of MY
when wind velocity is 5 m s
–1
, but the relationship
r everses when the wind velocity is 10 m s
–1
. The num-
ber of cells in the euphotic zone plays the major role in
the outcome of the P
R
ratio. For instance, when the
wind condition is 5 m s
–1
, the number of the cells in the
1% sur face P AR strata for the YK scheme is 864 at
noon, while the number for the MY scheme is 917. On
the other hand, when the wind is 10 m s
–1
, the number
of cells for MY at noon is 389, and the corr esponding
number for YK is 660. This differ ence in the trans-
portation of cells can be explained by the eddy dif fu-
sivity values for each case. Obviously , the lar ger trans-
port arises fr om larger eddy dif fusivity (Fig. 2). The
r esult fr om PS simulation also reveals that r ecovery of
production fr om inhibition can be easily masked by
variation of a cell’ s r epresentative depth given by its
centroid. Thus, the r esult of production varies consid-
erably , depending on the phytoplankton ver tical distri-
bution.
The computations with several differ ent initial con-
ditions reveal that our r esults depend on the initial
conditions; the small differ ence in daily production
(Fig. 8) was due to a compensation of strengthening
and weakening stratification. When we employed a
differ ent initial condition, we recognized the impor-
tance of the residual nighttime convective mixing that
affected the pr oduction in the next morning. We also
learned that the initial distribution of par ticles consid-
erably changes the total daily production.
Why are the total daily pr oductions so similar?
This investigation suggests that 2 factors influence
total production: (1) buoyancy and (2) the depth range
for full inhibition. As we mentioned, there ar e 2 cases
(5 and 10 m s
–1
cases for T ype I) in which the MY and
YK schemes yield differ ent results (Figs. 5 & 6). A
strong wind weakens stratification quickly, thus the
buoyancy change causes a change in turbulence
intensity . For the Type I case at 10 m s
–1
during an
early part of mor ning, the solar radiation is not strong
enough to provide suf ficient buoyancy in the surface
layer, thus the eddy diffusivity in the surface layer
increases quickly, and cells experience large vertical
excursions. This stratification change does not take
place in the YK scheme. However, during mid-day ,
the solar radiation becomes strong enough to sup-
press the turbulence intensity due to r estratification.
26
Nagai et al.: A Lagrangian model for the photoresponse of phytoplankton
Also, the fully inhibited domain expands to
greater depths. This combination r educes the
discrepancy between the MY and YK schemes.
T owar d the end of daylight hours, winds are
strong enough to deepen the mixing layer and
weaken the stratification. The elevated eddy
diffusivity causes an extended range of ver tical
excursion for cells. Hence, 2 peaks in the dis-
crepancy appear ed in the T ype I case (Fig. 9).
W ith T ype III water and 10 m s
–1
wind, the
buoyancy effects ar e not very dif ferent fr om the
T ype I case. In fact, the eddy dif fusivity pattern is
similar in time and space (Fig. 1). However, the
fully inhibited domain does not occur even near
the surface, thus the discr epancy is ruled by the
buoyancy effect cr eating a single peak in Fig. 9.
To elucidate the impact of buoyancy, we con-
ducted additional simulations without the re-
stratification process, i.e. no heat is pr ovided to
the water column. For each MY case, we ran 10
r ealizations with 1000 unifor mly distributed
cells. Dotted lines in Fig. 8 show the no restratifi-
cation cases. The increases in total pr oduction
caused by vertical mixing wer e almost doubled
from the original cases. Because no r estratification
takes place, the eddy diffusivity incr eases until a
steady state condition for kinetic energy balance is
r eached (Fig. 10). Clearly, without a restratification
process, the MY and YK schemes would dif fer in total
production (br oken lines in Fig. 8). In other words, the
total production based on the MY scheme is close to
that of YK due to a reduced pr oduction resulting fr om
the restratification pr ocess that compensates for an
earlier opposite deviation causes by deep mixing.
10 d simulation
We extended the single-day simulations to 10 d for
both the restratification and the non-r estratification
cases. T o focus on the total pr oduction
within the euphotic zone, we computed
an average production among those
cells located above the 1 % surface ir ra-
diance depth range. Fig. 11 repr esents
time-integrated production per cell for
each case. Because the PAR increases
as λ
2
decreases (Table 1, Eq. 7), the pro-
duction per cell for the T ype I case is the
highest among all cases. According to
an empirical relationship between the
light attenuation coefficient and pig-
ment concentration (Morel 1988), our λ
2
cases, i.e. 23.0 m for T ype I, 7.9 m for
T ype III, and 3.3 m for Type 9, are
equivalent to about 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 µg l
–1
of chl a con-
centration, respectively. Although the T ype 9 case is
the least productive, the number of cells for this case is
100 times larger than the Type I case if the chl a per
cell is assumed constant.
At the end of the 10 d simulation, the discrepancy
between the MY and YK schemes is still less than 5 %
(Fig. 11a). The mixing in a water column occurs peri-
odically and is not differ ent between days over 10 d.
The only differ ence from the 1 d simulation is the
strength of the eddy dif fusivity in the morning fr om the
second day . As we mentioned befor e, the results fr om
simulations that are star ted from sunset show that P
R
ratios are identical to the original computation star ted
at sunrise when wind is moderate, while somewhat
larger pr oduction was generated with strong wind.

However, even after 10 d, the discrepancy is still small.
On the other hand, the results fr om the no restratifica-
tion case show the large dif ferences between the MY
and YK runs. This emphasizes that the small dif fer-
ences are maintained by the stabilizing ef fect of solar
radiation (Fig. 11b).
Is mixing important for the total pr oduction?
At the end of the 1 d simulation for the 10 m s
–1
wind
speed condition, the total production simulated fr om
the MY scheme is elevated from a non-mixing condi-
tion by as much as 7.4 % with T ype 9 water. With T ype
I water, the same condition provides a 2.4 % increase.
Are these dif ferences significant? The numbers ar e not
very lar ge, but these values should be compared with
the maximum increase expected fr om fully adapted
cases. When cells are uninhibited by the ambient light,
the local production follows the dark-adapted PI cur ve
of the present photor esponse model that gives a maxi-
mum production. The maximum incr ease is 18, 24 and
80 % for T ypes 9, III and I, r espectively . Hence, wind
mixing is not effective for high λ
2
values compared
with these maximum increases. Thus, photor esponse
due to wind mixing is an insignificant factor for the
open-water case. On the other hand, when coastal wa-
ter condition is considered, the photor esponse is an im-
portant factor.
This conclusion is essentially the same
argument as that pr ovided by Franks &
Marra (1994), although their P
R
, which
was 1.30 for T ype 9 water and 10 m s
–1
wind, was much larger than our r esult
(1.07). While we used both the MY and YK
schemes, Franks & Marra (1994) used only
the YK scheme. We demonstrated that as
far as the total production is concer ned
both physical schemes resulted in nearly
the same amount of production under the
selected initial conditions. Ther e are 2 ma-
jor differ ences between their model and
ours. First, the Franks – Marra model does
not allow an individual pseudo-cell to re-
cover from inhibition when it is in a dark
deep layer, and their response time-scale
is not a constant (~1.5 h at the maximum),
while our time-scale is a constant (1 h).
Second, their use of the random walk
scheme may induce apparent advection of
cells, as we discussed in Appendix 1 (Fig.
A2). We suspect that some cells are artifi-
cially advected toward a deep section and
this may provide the dif ference fr om our
r esults.

Appendix 1. Random walk with a variable diffusivity
When random walk with a variable diffusivity is con-
sidered, the simulation causes an unphysical aggr ega-
tion (Hollaway 1993) that requir es a correction
scheme. When the background dif fusivity is a fixed
function, a few authors have suggested corr ection
schemes (Hunter et al. 1993, Visser 1997). No scheme
has been suggested for a case where the dif fusivity
changes in space as well as in time, such as the case
for the Mello – Yamada model. Here, we summarize a
proposed scheme. A detailed discussion can be found
in Y amazaki & Nagai (2004).
Both Hunter et al. (1993) and Visser (1997) suggested
the following corr ection scheme:
(A1)
V ariables in Eq. (A1) are the same as in Eq. (11). To test
an extreme case, we assume a 2-layer system; the sur-
face layer is at 20°C and the subsurface layer is at 10°C.
At the interface, the eddy dif fusivity abruptly decreases
to 0, so the diffusivity changes almost discontinuously.
The winds are kept at 10 m s
–1
for 24 h, while the
Mello – Yamada model computes the evolution of the
mixed layer . The non-motile cells are located uniformly
(US) throughout the water column. No solar radiation is
applied to the simulation. The average eddy diffusivity
profile is given in Fig. A1d. The uncor rected case

showed a significant aggregation of cells at the interface
(Fig. A1a). The corr ection scheme reduced the aggr e-
gation, but still a noticeable aggregation appear ed at the
interface (Fig. A1b). Thus, when the dif fusivity drops to
0, the corr ection scheme is not effective. We add a back-
ground dif fusivity to avoid the aggregation pr oblem
caused by the null diffusivity. The molecular viscosity
scale is sufficient to avoid the aggr egation (Fig. A1c).
The same technique was applied to the YK scheme
for non-motile cells released fr om a point source at
the surface. The initial conditions wer e the same as in
Y amazaki & Kamykowski (1991). The winds were
kept constant at 10 m s
–1
. The peak in cell abundance
moved away from the sur face when no corr ection
was applied. At the end of the simulation (24 h later),
the centroid appear ed at 15 m depth with corr ection,
while the centroid r eached about 18 m depth without
corr ection caused by the unphysical advection effect
(Fig. A2). The 3 m differ ence in the centroid position
may be important, but the swimming ability of motile
cells may exceed the differ ence. It should be noted
that a lower number of cells are found in the upper
few meters without the corr ection than with the cor-
r ection. This dif ference in the upper few meters may
become crucial, depending upon the tar get organism.

        The effect of historical (vs. contemporary) environmental factors has also been explored in the context of light adaption of phytoplankton and found to affect primary productivity in some cases (e.g., turbid coastal waters) [23, 24] . Phytoplankton models that include transport from hydrodynamic models have the effect of currents built in [15, 25].
    The Role of Ocean Currents in the Temperature Selection of Plankton: Insights from an Individual-Based Model
    [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Biogeography studies that correlate the observed distribution of organisms to environmental variables are typically based on local conditions. However, in cases with substantial translocation, like planktonic organisms carried by ocean currents, selection may happen upstream and local environmental factors may not be representative of those that shaped the local population. Here we use an individual-based model of microbes in the global surface ocean to explore this effect for temperature. We simulate up to 25 million individual cells belonging to up to 50 species with different temperature optima. Microbes are moved around the globe based on a hydrodynamic model, and grow and die based on local temperature. We quantify the role of currents using the “advective temperature differential” metric, which is the optimum temperature of the most abundant species from the model with advection minus that from the model without advection. This differential depends on the location and can be up to 4°C. Poleward-flowing currents, like the Gulf Stream, generally experience cooling and the differential is positive. We apply our results to three global datasets. For observations of optimum growth temperature of phytoplankton, accounting for the effect of currents leads to a slightly better agreement with observations, but there is large variability and the improvement is not statistically significant. For observed Prochlorococcus ecotype ratios and metagenome nucleotide divergence, accounting for advection improves the correlation significantly, especially in areas with relatively strong poleward or equatorward currents.

        However, new observations (Townsend et al., 1992; Backhaus et al., 2003; Behrenfeld, 2010) and modelling studies (e.g. Huisman et al., 1999; Nagai et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2011; Mahadevan et al., 2012) identify flaws in Sverdrup's critical depth model based on the development of a spring bloom before the onset of stratification. One of the processes potentially influencing winter light conditions and thus winter production is the occurrence of deep convection (Backhaus et al., 2003).
    Interactive effects of temperature and light during deep convection: A case study on growth and condition of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii
    [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Aim of this study was to expose phytoplankton to growth conditions simulating deep winter convection in the North Atlantic and thereby to assess changes in physiology enabling their survival. Growth rate, biochemical composition, and photosynthetic activity of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were determined under two different light scenarios over a temperature range of 5–15°C to simulate conditions experienced by cells during winter deep convection. These metrics were examined under a low light scenario (20 µmol m−2 s−1, 12/12 h light/dark), and compared with a scenario of short light pulses of a higher light intensity (120 µmol m−2 s−1, 2/22 h light/dark). Both experimental light conditions offered the same daily light dose. No growth was observed at temperatures below 8°C. Above 8°C, growth rates were significantly higher under low light conditions compared with those of short pulsed light exposures, indicating a higher efficiency of light utilization. This could be related to (i) a higher content of Chl a per cell in the low light trial and/or (ii) a more efficient transfer of light energy into growth as indicated by constantly low carbohydrate levels. In contrast, pulsed intense light led to an accumulation of carbohydrates, which were catabolized during the longer dark period for maintaining metabolism. Light curves measured via Chl a fluorescence indicated low light assimilation for the algae exposed to short pulsed light. We postulate that our trial with short light pluses did not provide sufficient light to reach full light saturation. In general, photosynthesis was more strongly affected by temperature under pulsed light than under low light conditions. Our results indicate that model estimates of primary production in relation to deep convection, which are based on average low light conditions, not considering vertical transportation of algae will lead to an overestimation of in situ primary production.

        These act on time scales of a few days on a length scale set by the cross frontal distance, and include large intermittent nutrient fluxes driven by the ageostrophic vertical circulation as well as strong mixing events associated with wave generation and instabilities at the front (Nagai et al., 2012). These may fuel primary production by increasing upwards transport of nutrients, or entrain phytoplankton cells more quickly than they can photo-acclimate ( Nagai et al, 2003 ; Falkowski and Raven, 2007) which could have a negative effect on primary production.

    Fine scale phytoplankton community structure across the Kuroshio Front
    [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Concurrent physical, chemical and biological observations across the Kuroshio Front collected in October 2009 provide a detailed view of the relationship between the physical environment and the phytoplankton community. Depth profiles were taken at stations ∼9 km apart along five 70 km transects. With a combination of flow cytometry, microscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatography pigment analysis, we characterized the phytoplankton community structure across the front. The observed phytoplankton community fell into two distinct assemblages, largely separated by the front, but which also reflected patterns in the distribution of Kuroshio and Oyashio water masses shaped by mesoscale lateral mixing. Phytoplankton biomass was elevated where there was a positive vertical flux of nitrate towards the surface, and the frontal circulation drove a lateral transport of nutrients southwards into the subtropical gyre. The observations showed that the phytoplankton respond to forcing on several scales: the phytoplankton community across the front was shaped by a combination of the large scale biogeography of the region, mesoscale mixing of populations and finer scale modification of the light and nutrient environment.

    Coastal bathing water quality and climate change – A new information and simulation system for new challenges
    [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Human pathogenic micro-organisms in coastal waters receive increasing attention. Climate change with its multiple effects on micro-organisms is one major reason. Changing survival rates, sources and new invasive species are a challenge for bathing water quality management. We present a new online bathing water information system. It includes an alerting system, software to supports communication between authorities, local municipalities and the public as well as simulation tools, based on a 3D-flow and particle tracking model. In scenario simulations with focus on enterococci and Escherichia coli bacteria we show the potential impact of climate change on bathing water quality and the potential relevance as a decision support system in the large, shallow Szczecin lagoon. Szczecin lagoon in the Baltic at the German/Polish border is a pollution hot-spot and frequent bathing prohibitions hamper tourism development. Because of climate change, the risk of river floods is supposed to increase in future. Higher discharge causes an increased transport velocity in the river flow. At the same time, run-off from city surfaces and agricultural land along the river can cause increased E. coli concentrations in all surface waters. As a consequence E. coli and especially Enterococci are transported far into the lagoon and high concentrations can cause bathing water quality problems even on distant beaches. Especially heavy lasting rain in the river basin together with local rain events are a serious threat for bathing water quality in the lagoon and will very likely require a closing of beaches for swimming. Similar to other coastal waters, a wide range of other potentially human pathogenic micro-organisms might create a threat for the lagoon in future.

        These values change the total production but do not affect the photoinhibition behaviors that are modified by E b and Y T . We have assigned the same value to E b as Nagai et al. (2003) , namely 200 (mmol m À 2 s À 1 ). This value is rather low, with the intention of emphasizing the sensitivity to photoinhibition.
    A Lagrangian model for phototaxis-induced thin layer formation
    [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: We have developed a Lagrangian model to investigate a potential mechanism based on phototaxis behavior of phytoplankton cells for the formation of thin layers. We assume that all cells follow a time-regulated diurnal vertical migration during which they experience photo-acclimation based on the Denman and Marra (1986) model. When a cell experiences stress due to strong light that exceeds a threshold level, the cell swims downward, away from the light. We applied the Lagrangian model to a one dimensional second order turbulence closure model that generates a realistic surface mixing condition for a given set of physical parameters, such as wind and optical water type. For the chosen swimming velocities and prescribed behavior, we found that, in coastal water type and Jerlov III type, thin layer formation takes place up to 5 m s−1 winds, while 10 m s−1 winds cause sufficiently strong mixing to prevent the formation of thin layer. We have also investigated the effects of changing the irradiance threshold for the onset of the photoinhibition, the initial density profile and random walk swimming. In conclusion, thin layer formation due to photoinhibition may be possible for a low value of photoinhibition threshold that may occur either due to upwelling or strong light exposure.

        Particularly in coastal areas or estuaries, where strong turbulent mixing in combination with high light attenuation coefficients may subject the cells to large and rapid changes in light intensity (e.g. Lizon et al. 1998, Sharples et al. 2001, Moore et al. 2006, Ross & Sharples 2007), or during deep mixing events in the open ocean in winter and spring (e.g.Fig. 1 in Ross et al. 2008, Woods & Onken 1982 , Nagai et al. 2003 ), the associated error can become quite large. Alternative approaches have been devised which aim to alleviate this problem by simulating the large-scale vertical displacements due to turbulence by moving the incubation bottles up and down through the water column or using on-deck incubators that expose the samples to variations in light intensity (Marra 1978, Köhler 1997, Köhler et al. 2001, Gocke & Lenz 2004).
    Modelling the effect of vertical mixing on bottle incubations for determining in situ phytoplankton dynamics. II. Primary production
    [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Reliable estimates of in situ phytoplankton growth rates are central to understanding the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. A common approach for estimating in situ growth rates is to incubate natural phytoplankton assemblages in clear bottles at fixed depths or irradiance levels and measure the change in chlorophyll a (Chl) over the incubation period (typically 24 h). Using a modelling approach, we investigate the accuracy of these Chl-based methods focussing on 2 aspects: (1) in a freely mixing surface layer, the cells are typically not in balanced growth, and with photoacclimation, changes in Chl may yield different growth rates than changes in carbon; and (2) the in vitro methods neglect any vertical movement due to turbulence and its effect on the cells' light history. The growth rates thus strongly depend on the incubation depth and are not necessarily representative of the depth-integrated in situ growth rate in the freely mixing surface layer. We employ an individual based turbulence and photosynthesis model, which also accounts for photoacclimation and photo inhibition, to show that the in vitro Chl-based growth rate can differ both from its carbon-based in vitro equivalent and from the in situ value by up to 100%, depending on turbulence intensity, optical depth of the mixing layer, and incubation depth within the layer. We make recommendations for choosing the best depth for single-depth incubations. Furthermore we demonstrate that, if incubation bottles are being oscillated up and down through the water column, these systematic errors can be significantly reduced. In the present study, we focus on Chl-based methods only, while productivity measurements using carbon-based techniques (e.g. C-14) are discussed in Ross et al. (2011; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 435:33-45).

How Do Sinking Phytoplankton Species Manage to Persist?
March 2002

Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis. Yet, most phytoplankton species are heavier than water and therefore sink. How can these sinking species persist? Somehow, the answer should lie in the turbulent motion that redisperses sinking phytoplankton over the vertical water column. Here, we show, using a reaction‐advection‐diffusion equation of light‐limited phytoplankton, that there is a... [Show full abstract]
