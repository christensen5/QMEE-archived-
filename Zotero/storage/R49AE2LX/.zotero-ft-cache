    Abstract: Myths and legends across the world contain many stories of deluges and floods. Some of these have been attributed to tsunami events. Doggerland in the southern North Sea is a submerged landscape thought to have been heavily affected by a tsunami such that it was abandoned by Mesolithic human populations at the time of the event. The tsunami was generated by the Storegga submarine landslide off the Norwegian coast which failed around 8150 years ago. At this time there were also rapid changes in sea level associated with deglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet and drainage of its large proglacial lakes, with the largest sea level jumps occurring just prior to the Storegga event. The tsunami affected a large area of the North Atlantic leaving sedimentary deposits across the region, from Greenland, through the Faroes, the UK, Norway and Denmark. From these sediments, run-up heights of up to 20 metres have been estimated in the Shetland Isles and several metres on mainland Scotland. However, sediments are not preserved everywhere and so reconstructing how the tsunami propagated across the North Atlantic before inundating the landscape must be performed using numerical models. These models can also be used to recreate the tsunami interactions with now submerged landscapes, such as Doggerland. Here, the Storegga submarine slide is simulated, generating a tsunami which is then propagated across the North Atlantic and used to reconstruct the inundation on the Shetlands, Moray Firth and Doggerland. The uncertainty in reconstructing palaeobathymetry and the Storegga slide itself results in lower inundation levels than the sediment deposits suggest. Despite these uncertainties, these results suggest Doggerland was not as severely affected as previous studies implied. It is suggested therefore that the abandonment of Doggerland was primarily caused by rapid sea level rise prior to the tsunami event.
