    Abstract: Domain-specific high-productivity environments are playing an increasingly important role in scientific computing due to the levels of abstraction and automation they provide. In this paper we introduce Devito, an open-source domain-specific framework for solving partial differential equations from symbolic problem definitions by the finite difference method. We highlight the generation and automated execution of highly optimized stencil code from only a few lines of high-level symbolic Python for a set of scientific equations, before exploring the use of Devito operators in seismic inversion problems.
