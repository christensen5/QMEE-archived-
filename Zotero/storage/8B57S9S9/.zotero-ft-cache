phytoplankton

Patchiness plays a fundamental role in phytoplankton ecology by dictating the rate at which individual cells encounter each other and their predators. The distribution of motile phytoplankton species is often considerably more patchy than that of non-motile species at submetre length scales, yet the mechanism generating this patchiness has remained unknown. Here we show that strong patchiness at small scales occurs when motile phytoplankton are exposed to turbulent ﬂow. We demonstrate experimentally that Heterosigma akashiwo forms striking patches within individual vortices and prove with a mathematical model that this patchiness results from the coupling between motility and shear. When implemented within a direct numerical simulation of turbulence, the model reveals that cell motility can prevail over turbulent dispersion to create strong fractal patchiness, where local phytoplankton concentrations are increased more than 10-fold. This ‘unmixing’ mechanism likely enhances ecological interactions in the plankton and offers mechanistic insights into how turbulence intensity impacts ecosystem productivity.

Patchiness in the distribution of phytoplankton has long intrigued ﬁshermen and scientists alike, because it generates hotspots of organisms at higher trophic levels1,2 and modulates species diversity3, rates of ﬁsh recruitment4 and population stability5. While phytoplankton patchiness at large spatial scales is driven by reproduction, growth is too slow to generate structure at scales t1 km vis-a`-vis the homogenizing effect of turbulence6,7. Below this bottleneck scale, patchiness generated by locally enhanced growth is transferred to progressively smaller scales by turbulent stirring.
Whereas traditional plankton sampling techniques that utilize nets and bottles average over scales of metres, new technologies, including high-resolution ﬂuorometers8,9, underwater imaging10,11 and syringe arrays12, offer vastly improved resolution of plankton distributions, and have revealed that the microscale (B1–10 cm) distribution of motile phytoplankton species (for example, dinoﬂagellates) is often considerably more patchy than the distribution of non-motile species (for example, diatoms)10–12. However, the mechanisms that underlie this observation have remained elusive. Here we show that phytoplankton motility, when occurring in a turbulent ﬂow, generates intense patchiness, far exceeding that of randomly distributed, non-motile populations.

Supplementary Movie 1). In addition to swimming into downwelling regions, as previously predicted14,15 and observed in pipe ﬂow16, they accumulated inside the vortices’ cores, showing that individual vortices can trigger striking patches of motile phytoplankton. In contrast, killed cells remained randomly distributed (Supplementary Fig. S2), demonstrating that motility was an essential ingredient of patchiness.
Motility is a pervasive trait of phytoplankton. For example, 90% of species forming harmful algal blooms can swim17. Motility allows cells to reside near the surface during daylight hours to enhance light acquisition while accessing deeper waters with more nutrients and lower predation risk at night18,19. To migrate through the water column, many species rely on a stabilizing torque that biases their swimming in the vertical direction20,21. This stabilizing torque competes with the viscous torque exerted on cells by ﬂuid shear (speciﬁcally, the spatial gradients in ﬂuid velocity that contribute to vorticity), which acts to overturn cells. The resulting directed motility is termed gyrotaxis, and the gyrotactic reorientation timescale, B—the characteristic time a perturbed cell takes to return to its vertical equilibrium orientation, k—provides a measure of how unstable the cell is to shear20–22.

Results
H. akashiwo motility within a steady vortex ﬂow. Following the tradition of using a vortical ﬂow as a ﬁrst proxy for small-scale turbulence13, we exposed the motile, harmful algal bloom forming phytoplankter H. akashiwo to a steady vortex pair created via cavity ﬂow (Fig. 1a,b; Methods). Video microscopy revealed that motile cells formed dense patches (Fig 1c,

Gyrotactic motility within simulated ﬂow ﬁelds. The hypothesis that the observed patchiness (Fig. 1c) originated from the coupling of motility and the shear in the vortical ﬂow is strongly supported by a mathematical model of gyrotactic motility21 (Methods). When parameterized with the measured swimming properties of H. akashiwo, this model yields cell distributions in close agreement with experiments (Fig. 1c,d; Supplementary

As H. akashiwo directs its motility opposite to gravity, cells that were able to escape the ﬂow collected on the device’s upper boundary: we thus used a nonlinear colourmap to simultaneously visualize these surface aggregations and those within the vortex cores. In a control experiment, killed cells remained randomly distributed (Supplementary Fig. S2). Asterisks denote dimensional variables and gravity acts in the –z direction.

However, will patches of cells also occur in turbulent ﬂow, where individual vortices are short-lived and the action of many vortices tends to disperse patchiness? To ﬁnd out, we seeded a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence with up to 3.2 Â 106 cells, whose motility was governed by the same model of gyrotaxis, and followed their trajectories until their spatial

distribution reached a statistical steady state (Methods). We found that turbulence drives intense patchiness in the distribution of motile phytoplankton (Fig. 2b,c; Supplementary Movie 3), whereas non-motile cells follow the ﬂow and remain randomly distributed (Fig. 2a).

the shear from small scales where ﬂuid viscosity dissipates energy.

The characteristic size and shear rate of these dissipative

scales are proportional to the Kolmogorov length scale, ZK ¼

(n3/e)1/4B0.1–10 mm, (e/n)1/2B0.01–10 s À 1,

and Kolmogorov respectively, where

shear rate, oK ¼ n is the kinematic

viscosity of seawater and e the rate at which turbulent energy is dissipated23–25. Two dimensionless parameters then control the

cells’ fate: the swimming number, F ¼ VC/VK, measuring the

swimming speed VC velocities VK ¼ ZKoK

relative ¼ (ne)1/4

to characteristic small-scale (the Kolmogorov velocity),

ﬂuid and

the stability number, C ¼ BoK, measuring how unstable upward

swimming cells are to overturning by shear. We note that while

most turbulent energy is dissipated by ﬂuid motion with length

scales larger than ZK (ref. 23) the Kolmogorov scales remain the appropriate parameters for dimensionless analysis

(Supplementary Fig. S8; Supplementary Methods).

Through coupling with turbulence, motility can increase local cell

concentrations by one or more orders of magnitude. To quantify local

cell concentrations, we used a three-dimensional Voronoi tessellation26 (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Methods). The fraction f of cells

having the largest local concentration were deﬁned as patches and

used to compute the patch concentration enhancement factor,

Q ¼ (C—CP)/CM, where C is the mean cell concentration within patches, CP is its counterpart for a random (that is, non-motile) distribution of cells (which also harbours ﬂuctuations in cell

concentration), and CM is the overall cell concentration. Thus, Q is a dimensionless measure of the increase in the local cell concentration

due to motility. We found that motility can profoundly affect patch

intensity. For example, the 10% most aggregated motile cells (f ¼ 0.1)

for C ¼ 1 and F ¼ 2.68 were nearly 10 times (Q ¼ 8) more

concentrated than the 10% most aggregated non-motile cells

(Fig. 2e). For the 1% most aggregated cells (f ¼ 0.01), the

enhancement is 450-fold (Q ¼ 51). As patches are continuously

born by motility and killed by turbulent dispersion, each cell

transiently samples regions with high concentrations of conspeciﬁcs,

on average spending a fraction of time f in regions where the local

concentration is Q-fold larger than that of a random distribution.

The patchiness intensity depends on both phytoplankton

physiology and environmental conditions. Fast swimming cells

(large F) with intermediate stability (CB1) form the most

concentrated patches (Fig. 2f). Owing to the incompressibility of

the ﬂuid, cells can form patches only if they swim across

streamlines to converge within speciﬁc regions of the ﬂow: they

do so most effectively when their speed is large and their

stabilizing torque strikes a balance between producing a

swimming direction that is highly unstable and isotropic

(C441) and one that is very stable and uniformly upwards (Coo1; Supplementary Fig. S9)22.

Motility-driven unmixing generates strong patchiness for

conditions that commonly occur in the ocean. The reorientation timescale, while known only for a handful of species16,20,21,27–29,

generally spans the range BB1–10 s, which, for typical turbulent

dissipation rates (e ¼ 10 À 8–10 À 6 m2 s À 3), corresponds to

CB1. Phytoplankton 1,000 mm s À 1, are often

swimming comparable

speeds30,31, VCB100– to or larger than the

Kolmogorov velocities, VKB300–1,000 mm s À 1, associated with

these dissipation rates, suggesting F can often be of order unity.

Thus, we expect that phytoplankton routinely inhabit regions of

the [C, F] parameter space where patchiness is intense (Fig. 2f).

Importantly, our results indicate that phytoplankton do not need

to swim faster than the speed of large-scale turbulent ﬂuctuations

to defy the homogenizing effect of turbulent dispersion, as previously suggested10, they only need to swim at speeds

comparable to Kolmogorov ﬂuctuations.

Which feature of turbulence is responsible for patchiness? In

contrast to steady vortical ﬂow, where multiple mechanisms

produce patches15, in turbulent ﬂow we found a consistent,

strong correlation between cell location and downward ﬂow

velocity (Fig. 3d), suggesting that patchiness results from a

dominant mechanism: cell focusing in local downwelling regions.

This result generalizes previous observations of gyrotactic focusing in laminar downwelling ﬂows21 and is rationalized by

a theoretical analysis of the compressibility of the cell velocity

ﬁeld v ¼ u þ Fp (the superposition of ﬂow velocity, u, and

swimming velocity, Fp, where p is the swimming direction and

all velocities are non-dimensionalized by VK). As v has nonvanishing divergence, = Á v ¼ F= Á p ¼ À CFr2uz (for Coo1; where uz is the vertical component of u; Methods), patches form (= Á vo0) where r2uz40, or equivalently in downwelling ﬂow (uzo0), because r2uz and uz are negatively correlated (Supplementary Fig. S7; Methods). Both of these predictions are

in good agreement with simulations (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig.

S6), suggesting our analytical results offer a rational, mechanistic

framework to interpret how motile phytoplankton form patches

in disordered ﬂows.

Motility substantially decreases the distance between neigh-

bouring phytoplankton cells, altering the topology of their

distribution. We found that the probability p(r) that a pair of

cells reside less than a distance r from each other is enhanced for

for ro0.2ZK (ZKB1 mm),

(for this

translates to a 4100-fold increase in the probability that a

conspeciﬁc resides within B200 mm of a given cell. Whereas non-

motile cells are randomly distributed in three-dimensional space, with p(r)Br3, for motile cells we found that p(r)BrD with Do3

(Fig. 3a,b), signifying that the cell distribution is not volumeﬁlling, but instead occupies a lower-dimensional fractal set32.

Fractal clustering of particles in ﬂuids is well known, for example in particles ﬂoating on ﬂuid surfaces33 and water droplets in clouds34, and arises as a consequence of an effective

compressibility, which here stems from the ability of cells to

swim across streamlines. Our analysis of the divergence of v

correctly predicts the patchiness topology: weakly compressible

ﬂows are expected to produce particle distributions residing on a fractal set of codimension D ¼ 3 À a(CF)2, where a is a constant and Coo1 (Methods and Falkovich et al.34). This relation

successfully captured the behaviour of the fractal dimension D computed from simulations for Co1 (Fig. 3c), conﬁrming that

the interaction of motility and turbulent ﬂow results in an

effective compressibility, which generates patchiness.

Discussion
Patchiness generated by motility-driven unmixing may have a multitude of consequences for phytoplankton. On the one hand, patchiness may be advantageous during times of sexual reproduction, as it reduces distances between conspeciﬁc cells and could increase the local concentration of phytoplanktonexuded toxins that stiﬂe competitors35. On the other hand, patchiness could be detrimental because it sharpens competition for nutrients36 and enhances grazing by zooplankton37,38, whose ﬁnely tuned foraging strategies allow them to retain their position within centimeter-scale prey patches2. The interaction of motility and turbulence could thus be an important determinant of the relative success of different phytoplankton species and provide a mechanistic basis to help decipher the powerful role turbulence is known to exert on plankton community composition39.
Unlike passive mechanisms that generate patchiness, such as turbulent stirring, motility-driven unmixing stems from active cell behaviour, opening the intriguing possibility that phytoplankton could regulate their small-scale spatial distribution by adaptively adjusting their position in [C, F] space (Fig. 2f).

Figure 3 | Gyrotactic cells in a DNS of turbulence. Gyrotactic cells collect in downwelling regions, reducing the distance between neighbouring cells and
triggering fractal patchiness. (a) Probability p(r) that two cells reside at a distance less than r from each other. While at large scales (r410ZK) the distribution of both non-motile (F ¼ 0) and motile (F40) cells is volume-ﬁlling (p(r)Br3), at small scales (ro10ZK) motile cells exhibit fractal patchiness (p(r)BrD with Do3). (b) The fractal dimension D is smallest, corresponding to strongest patchiness, at intermediate stability numbers (CB1) and large swimming speeds (large F). (c) The theoretical prediction of the fractal dimension, D ¼ 3–a(CF)2 (Methods), accurately captures the simulation results for Co1 (here, a ¼ 1.73 and r2 ¼ 0.92). (d) The non-dimensional vertical ﬂuid velocity averaged over the positions of all cells, ouz4, shows that populations with intermediate stability (CB1) are more likely to reside in downwelling regions (ouz4o0, coloured lines). This correlation increases with the swimming number, F. For comparison, there is no correlation with horizontal ﬂuid velocities (grey symbols). (d, inset) Rescaling ouz4 by F reveals that ouz4 can reach B30% of the swimming speed, reducing rates of upward migration.

Cells could regulate F by modulating swimming speed and C by altering ﬂagellar stroke20, overall shape40 or chloroplast position41. Individuals could then actively increase encounter rates with conspeciﬁcs, without need for chemical communication, by swimming faster and tuning stability such that CB1, or minimize predation risk by slowing down and avoiding the intermediate stability regime. Regardless of whether this mechanism is adaptive or static, these results suggest that small-scale patchiness is a corollary of vertical phytoplankton migration, and that motility-driven patch formation may thus be as common as the species that migrate through the water column. Future ﬁeld and laboratory experiments may reveal the tradeoffs of directed motility in a turbulent ocean and how it shapes the fate of those at the bottom of the marine food web.
Methods Phytoplankton culturing and preparation. H. akashiwo was grown by
inoculating 2 ml of exponential phase culture into 25 ml of sterile f/2 medium, then incubating at 25 °C under continuous ﬂuorescent illumination (70 mE m À 2 s À 1) for 21 days. The culture used in experiments was prepared by diluting 75 ml of the 21-day old culture with 500 ml of f/2 media to achieve a ﬁnal cell concentration of B2.5 Â 104 cells ml À 1. This concentration strikes a balance between maximizing the number of cells within the central plane (Fig. 1a, green box) and avoiding the bioconvective instabilities that arise when cell concentration exceeds a critical threshold21. In control experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2), cells were killed using ethanol (10% v/v) before their introduction into the device.
Experimental vortex apparatus. Two counter-rotating vortices were generated
within a custom-made transparent acrylic device (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1). A 0.3 ml s À 1 ﬂow of a H. akashiwo culture was driven through each of the two

vertical channels of the device using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, PHD 2000) loaded with two syringes (Monoject, 140 ml). A random distribution of cells was initialized within the central cavity of the device (Fig. 1a, green box) by clamping one of the two ﬂexible tubes (Cole Parmer C-Flex, ID 3 mm) that convey ﬂow to the device, which induced a unidirectional ﬂow through the central cavity. Once the tube was unclamped, vortical ﬂow was restored and the experiment began.
A laser sheet, generated using a continuous wave 8 mW Helium-Neon laser (Uniphase, model 1105 P) and a plano-concave cylindrical lens (Thorlabs, 20 mm focal length), illuminated cells along a 1.6-mm thick central plane ( À 0.8 mm oyÃo0.8 mm, where the asterisk denotes a dimensional variable) where the ﬂow was nearly two-dimensional due to symmetry. All images were captured at 20 Hz with a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (PCO 1600, Cooke) attached to a dissecting microscope (SMZ1000, Nikon).

Simulations of gyrotaxis within the experimental ﬂow ﬁeld. To model the ﬂow
within the experimental device, we solved the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with the ﬁnite element software COMSOL Multiphysics (Burlington, MA), using the experimental device’s exact geometry and imposed ﬂow rates. Gyrotactic motility was modelled by integrating the equation for the evolution of the swimming direction of a bottom-heavy spherical cell21

where p is the unit vector along the swimming direction, xÃ ¼ =Ã Â uÃ is the ﬂuid vorticity, tÃ is time, k ¼ [0,0,1] is a unit vector in the vertical upwards ( þ zÃ) direction, and B is the gyrotactic reorientation timescale, the characteristic time a perturbed cell takes to return to vertical if xÃ ¼ 0. The ﬁrst term on the right hand side describes the tendency of a cell to remain aligned along the vertical direction due to bottom-heaviness, while the second term captures the tendency of vorticity to overturn a cell by imposing a viscous torque on it. We neglect the effect of cells on the ﬂow. The cell position, XÃ ¼ (xÃ, yÃ, zÃ), was computed by integrating the velocity resulting from the superposition of the swimming velocity, VC p, and the

Cell positions and swimming directions were initialized at random locations

within the device and randomly on a unit sphere, respectively. Reﬂective boundary

conditions were applied at all solid boundaries. The swimming speed, VC, of each cell was drawn from a probability distribution obtained from H. akashiwo cells

swimming within the central plane of the experimental device in the absence of

ﬂow. Cell trajectories were obtained from movies recorded at 20 Hz using automated software (PredictiveTracker; Ouellette et al.42). To estimate the threedimensional swimming velocity from its measured (xÃ, zÃ) projection, we assumed isotropy in xÃ and yÃ to obtain VC ¼ (2vxÃ2 þ vzÃ2)1/2 where vxÃ and vzÃ are the instantaneous cell swimming speeds in the xÃ and zÃ direction, respectively. The resulting probability density for the cell swimming speed has a mean of 75 mm s À 1

(Supplementary Fig. S3). All 70,000 cells used in the simulation had a gyrotactic reorientation parameter of B ¼ 2 s, based on a previous estimate for H. akashiwo27.

Simulations of gyrotaxis within isotropic turbulence. We solved the three-
dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a fully periodic cubic domain of size LB ¼ 2p with M mesh points using a pseudo-spectral method with a vector potential representation to ensure ﬂuid incompressibility43. To eliminate aliasing errors, we used the 2/3 dealiasing technique, which sets the largest 1/3 of all wave numbers to zero after each computation of the nonlinear terms in the NavierStokes equation44, such that the largest resolved wavenumber is kmax ¼ (1/3)M1/3. Statistically stationary turbulence was sustained by applying homogeneous, isotropic, time-uncorrelated Gaussian forcing over a narrow shell of small wavenumbers45, which produces integral-scale ﬂuid ﬂuctuations (that is, the size L of the largest eddy) on the order of the domain size.
Once the velocity ﬁeld had reached a statistical steady state, gyrotactic cells were initialized with random position in the domain and with orientations randomly distributed over the unit sphere. We seeded the simulation box with 300,000– 3,200,000 cells depending on the Taylor Reynolds number Rel (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Methods). Cell trajectories were integrated using the nondimensional form of equations 1 and 2,

where time was non-dimensionalized by 1/oK, lengths by the Kolmogorov length scale ZK and velocities by the Kolmogorov velocity VK ¼ oKZK. Dimensionless parameters are F ¼ VC/VK and C ¼ BoK (oK is the Kolmogorov vorticity scale). At each time step of the simulation, the local ﬂuid ﬂow properties (x and u) at the
particle locations were calculated using a tri-linear interpolation from the
computational mesh points.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the trajectories of passive tracer
particles integrated via this numerical scheme accurately capture both the velocity46 and the acceleration47 statistics of the underlying DNS-derived ﬂow. Moreover, previous studies on clustering of inertial particles48 have demonstrated
the efﬁcacy of this method to resolve sub-Kolmogorov scale fractal aggregations,
which we also observed for gyrotactic swimmers.
All analyses were performed after cells had reached a statistically steady distribution, which requires B30–50 Kolmogorov time scales (1/oK), corresponding in our simulations to 1–2 integral time scales (the characteristic timescale
of the largest eddies in the ﬂow).

Theoretical prediction of accumulation in downwelling regions. In general,
the cell velocity ﬁeld, v ¼ u þ Fp, and its divergence, = Á v, depend on the history of
the trajectory of individual cells and can only be calculated statistically. However, in the limit of a large stabilizing torque (Coo1) the cell orientation quickly reaches equilibrium with the local ﬂuid vorticity, such that v can be directly calculated using the instantaneous ﬂow ﬁeld. Assuming Coo1, the solution to equation 3 is

to leading order in C. This predicts that cells swim upwards with a deviation proportional to C from the vertical. Imposing the incompressibility of the ﬂow (= Á u ¼ 0) and applying the deﬁnition of vorticity, substitution of equation 5 into equation 4 yields

= Á v ¼ À CFr2uz;

where uz is the vertical component of ﬂuid velocity, normalized by the Kolmogorov velocity, VK. Equation 6 predicts that the cell velocity is compressible and that aggregations form in regions where r2uz40. This prediction was conﬁrmed in the DNS simulations by calculating /r2uzS, deﬁned as the mean of r2uz at the position of the cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). We found that /r2uzS reaches a maximum for CB1 and increases monotonically with F, which mirrors the
dependence of the aggregation intensity on C and F (Figs 2f and 3b;

Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating that cells form patches in regions where /r2uzS is large.
The prediction that cells collect where r2uz40 generalizes prior observations that gyrotactic cells tend to collect in downwelling ﬂows21, because regions of the ﬂow where r2uz40 tend be highly correlated with regions of downwelling (uzo0). This correlation can be demonstrated either by analysing the results from the DNS

(Supplementary Fig. S7) or via theoretical analysis. The latter is brieﬂy outlined here. By recasting the Navier-Stokes equations as an energy balance one can write25

where all variables are dimensional (asterisks omitted for brevity), e is the average energy dissipation rate and the last equality assumes isotropic ﬂow. We can then rewrite the averaged quantity in the last term as:

where /r2uz|uz ¼ uS is a conditional average and P(u) is the probability density distribution of a single component of the ﬂow velocity ﬁeld at a ﬁxed point,

which for turbulent ﬂows is well approximated by the following Gaussian

Equation 10 is obtained by using a linear approximation for the conditional

average and substituting equation 9 into equation 8 and the result into equation 7

(ref. 49). The relation in equation 10, which shows good agreement with our

simulations (Supplementary Fig. S7) predicts that, on average, regions with positive r2uz are correlated with downwelling ﬂow (uzo0), and vice versa.
These two predictions, that is, that cells collect where r2uz40 and that r2uzB À uz, taken together, indicate that an effective compressibility in the cell velocity ﬁeld (produced by the cells’ motility) results in the formation of patches

within downwelling regions, rationalizing the results from the turbulence

simulations.

Theoretical prediction of D. In the previous section we showed that the cell’s
velocity ﬁeld v has non-vanishing divergence in the limit of a strong stabilizing torque (Coo1). In this limit, cells behave as passive tracers transported by a weakly compressible ﬂow, v ¼ u þ dw with = Á w ¼ À r2uz and d ¼ CF (equation 6). It has been previously shown that tracers in weakly compressible ﬂows (doo1) tend to form transient clusters of fractal codimension (3 À D)pd2 (refs 34,50–52). Thus for gyrotactic swimmers with Coo1, the fractal dimension is predicted as

D ¼ 3 À aðCFÞ2;

ð11Þ

where a is a constant that depends on the ﬂow. This result is in good agreement with our simulations for Co1 (Fig. 3c).
