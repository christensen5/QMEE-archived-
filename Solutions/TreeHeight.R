#Calculates the height of trees from the angle of elevation and
#       the distance from the base using the trigonometric formula
# Arguments: degrees (the angle of elevation), distances (the distance from the base)
#			       height = distance * tan(radians)

# Assign the functions in TreeHeight as degrees and distance

	height <- distance * tan (radians) #trig
	print (paste("Tree height is:", height))
